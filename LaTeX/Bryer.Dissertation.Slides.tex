\section{Overview}

\begin{frame}[c]
    \frametitle{Purpose}
    There are two primary purposes of this study:
    \vspace{15pt}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \setlength{\itemsep}{15pt}
        \item Explore the differences in performance between charter and traditional public schools. Additionally, examine the differences between state performances on NAEP in terms of the quality of state charter laws as measured by the \citeA{NAPCS2010a}.
        \item Develop new methods for analyzing and visualizing propensity score analysis for multilevel, or clustered, data.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{frame}


\subsection{What are Charter Schools?}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What are Charter Schools?}
	The first charter school opened in Minnesota in 1991
	In principle, charter schools have opted out of bureaucratic rules and union contracts in order to gain academic autonomy. The standard argument has become that this autonomy will lead to higher student test scores and better academic environments \cite{Wells2002}. The idea is that, under the charter framework, teachers, administrators, students and the community that comprise the charter school would be free to innovate

\end{frame}

\subsection{Literature Review}

\begin{frame}[c]
	\frametitle{National Studies Examining Charter and Traditional Public Schools}
	The number of studies that consider charter school effectiveness from a national perspective are limited.
	\vspace{10pt}
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \setlength{\itemsep}{10pt}
		\item \citeA{BraunJenkinsGrigg2006} examined charter and traditional public schools using hierarchal linear modeling (HLM) with NAEP 2005. They found that there was often no difference, and in some instances charter school students performed worse.
		\pause
		\item \textit{The CREDO Study} - \citeA{credo} conducted a study of more than 1.7 million records from 2400 charter within 16 states. The methodology involves creating a Virtual Control Record (VCR) for each charter school student which is used to find matching student from an eligible traditional public school.
		Overall results show that charter school students performed, on average, 0.01 and 0.03 standard deviations below public school students for reading and math, respectively.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%\begin{frame}[c]
%\begin{quote}    %Good quote... come back to the idea at some point!
%If, however, charter schools are not improving the achievement of disadvantaged children, it may be that the cause of low student performance is not bureaucratic rules but something else. When a treatment is based on a diagnosis, and the treatment doesn't work, it is prudent to examine not only whether the treatment should be improved, but also whether the diagnosis might be flawed. \cite{Carnoy2005}
%\end{quote}
%\end{frame}

\subsection{Issues with Charter Schools}

\begin{frame}[c]
	\frametitle{Issues with Charter Schools Research}
	\citeA{BettsHill2006} outline three major issues with charter school research:\vspace{15pt}
	\begin{enumerate}[<+-| alert@+>]
	    \setlength{\itemsep}{15pt}
		\item The issue of selection bias
		\item The variation in types or kinds of charter schools.
		\item The nature of student achievement. Research has shown there are numerous factors that contribute to student success including, but not limited to, social economic status, parental education, motivation, etc. The ability to decipher how school choice contributes to student learning in the context of all the other factors cannot help but be difficult.
	\end{enumerate}
    \vspace{15pt}
	\pause
	A fourth issue not cited by \citeA{BettsHill2006} is the role of charter school laws.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Research Question}

\begin{frame}[c]
	\frametitle{Research Questions}
	\begin{enumerate}[<+-| alert@+>]
    \setlength{\itemsep}{15pt}
	\item Given appropriate adjustments based on available student data, is there a discernible difference between charter and traditional public schools with regard to math and reading scores on the NAEP scores at grades 4 and 8?
    \item If so, what is the nature and magnitude of this difference for the two outcomes, reading and mathematics scores?
    \item What is the relationship, if any, of different charter school laws on charter school student performance in math and reading at grades 4 and 8?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\section{Method}

\subsection{Propensity Scores}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Propensity Scores}
    Propensity scores are the ``conditional probability of being in the treatment" \cite{RosenbaumRubin1983}, defined as:
    
    \begin{equation}
    \pi ({ X }_{ i }) \; \equiv \; Pr({ T }_{ i } = 1 | { X }_{ i })
    \end{equation}
    \pause
    
    Let $X$ is a matrix of observed covariates. The balancing property under exogeneity states that,

    \begin{equation}
    { T }_{ i } \; \upModels { X }_{ i } \;| \; \pi ({ X }_{ i })
    \end{equation}
    
    \pause
    For randomized experiments, the strong ignobility assumption states,

    \begin{equation}
    ({ Y }_{ i }(1),{ Y }_{ i }(0)) \; \upModels \; { T }_{ i }|{ X }_{ i }
    \end{equation}

    for all ${X}_{i}$. That is, treatment is independent of all covariates, observed or otherwise. 
    
    \pause
    However, the strong ignobility assumption can be restated with the propensity score as,

    \begin{equation}
    ({ Y }_{ i }(1),{ Y }_{ i }(0)) \; \upModels \; { T }_{ i } \; | \; \pi({ X }_{ i })
    \end{equation}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]
    \frametitle{Propensity Score Analysis in Two Phases}
    PSA is typically conducted in two phases:
    \vspace{15pt}
    \begin{description}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{15pt}
        \item[Phase 1] Estimate propensity scores (model the treatment indicator).
        \item[Phase 2] Estimate effects (model the outcome of interest).
    \end{description}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Propensity Score Matching}

\begin{frame}[c]
    \frametitle{Propensity Score Matching}
    Partial exact matching using nearest neighbor was used using the \texttt{Matching} \cite{matching} package. For each charter school student:
    \ \\\ \\
    \begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{10pt}
        \item Traditional public school students in the same state with the same gender and ethnicity are located.
        \item Of those students, the student with the smallest difference in propensity scores is selected and paired with that charter school student.
    \end{itemize}
    \ \\\ \\
    Three match sets were estimated: one-to-one, one-to-five, and one-to-ten.
    \ \\\ \\
    For each match set, a dependent sample \textit{t}-test were used to estimate ATE \cite{Austin2011}.

\section{Discussion \& Limitations}

\begin{frame}[c]
    \frametitle{Conclusions}
    \begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{10pt}
        \item There very little difference between the performance of charter and traditional public school in math and reading in grades 4 and 8 using NAEP as a measure of academic performance.
        \item The use of visualizations can/is be an important way to present results.
        \item The \texttt{multilevelPSA} R package is an important contribution to the PSA literature and is particularly useful in education research where many studies use data that is naturally multilevel (e.g. students within schools, within districts, within states).
        \item There is a small to moderate correlation between the quality of charter laws (as identified by NAPCS) and the outcomes from NAEP.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]
    \frametitle{Limitations}
    \begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{10pt}
        \item This study only examines reading and math and does not consider other important subjects (e.g. history, science, the arts, etc.).
        \item There is variation in the quality and types of charter and traditional public schools, but they are considered together (see issue two of charter school research identified by \citeA{BettsHill2006}).
        \item Achieving balance using the multilevel PSA methods requires large sample sizes, especially for logistic regression stratification methods.
        \item The analysis of the quality of charter laws is correlational. Further studies should look at how specific components that NAPCS has identified relate specifically to the performance of specific charter schools.
    \end{itemize}
